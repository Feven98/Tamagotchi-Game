Feven Seifu Tamagotchi-Game
1. About The Project
This is a project that was given by word to convert it into game tamagotchi. It use the value for hunger level, boerd level and sleep level from 0 to 10. When from the three levels that are stated, if one level is value become 10, the tamagotchi pet will be dead and the status of his dead will be shown. There is age button that start from 0 and increase until the value of the game end.

2. App functionality
It is not fully finished and need some adjustments to be worked on. Given the time and my knowledge on Java Script I could not finished it as I wanted it to be. But most of the parts work. It also need some styling.

3. Technology used : html, css and js

4. Challenges
My biggeset challenge was working on JavaScript. I used different methods and try different ways that takes me time. Trying to decrease the button and to work on start and reset, it takes me too much time.

5. User Story
As soon as the game start it will try to increase the value of the level. So user has to click on feed,turn off light and play button to let the pet live. If not the pet will die. There is a name tag which user can put their name and it will say welcome to tamagotvhi game and user name and there is anothe one which ask to name pet when clicked on start but both need adjustments.

6. Words of Wisdom
TRY! It is hard to understand all the code but from what I see and do, You will get better if you practice and work hard.
